Title:
- Design and Implementation of an Efficient and Fault-tolerant Caching System

- Problem:
  - Slow queries when involving large amounts of data

- Hypothesis:
  - It can be solved using some kind of transformation from 'data model'
  - Transformations are stored in file cache, database, whatever...
  - Transformation updates when 'data model' updates
  - Declarative transformations using python code?

- Subproblems to be solved:
  - Dependency tracking on 'data model' such that transformations are updated
    when the 'data model' is updated
  - Reliable transformations to ensure consistency
    - What happens when a transformation is not executed?
