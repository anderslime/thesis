#### How do we represent graph instances?

* Cayley

* Neo4j?
* Titan?
* Own implementation?
  * Advantage: simple for the purposes we have

#### How to update dirty/stale nodes?

In workers that run concurrently. For this we need some kind of scheduler that
can distribute the work s.t. as much as possible is done in parallel and
applies fault-tolerant measures.

#### How to identify node for querying?

Hmm...?

#### How to ensure correct order of changes?

Topological order for each graph. Some kind of know-how to what can run in
parallel?


#### Algorithm for finding the topological order?

- Let's wait. Not important.
