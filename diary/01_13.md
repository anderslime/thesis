#### How to identify node for querying?

- "Singleton nodes" can be identified by its name
- "Collection nodes" can be identified by its name and id?

#### How do we model the graphs in practice?

- Dependencies between graphs?

#### How do we dynamically add dependencies?

E.g. if an assignment has many handins. And we want to calculate the average
score for the assignment based on the scores of the handins.

#### How to ensure correct order of changes?

Topological order for each graph. Some kind of know-how to what can run in
parallel?


#### Algorithm for finding the topological order?

- Let's wait. Not important.
