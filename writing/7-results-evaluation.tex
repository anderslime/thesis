To prove efficiency:

- Test that a given function is not made slower after being cache
  - To test this we want to trigger an underlying data change and ensure it does
    introduce performance regression
- System load:
  - Test that functions are not executed more times than necessary
- Show that caching improves performance:
  - Examples where caching improves performance
- Test the 'warmup'

Maybe not to be tested, but to be argued:
- Software design:
  - Defend the library and how it's used
- Adaptablity
  - Defend the
