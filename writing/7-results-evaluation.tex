\chapter{Results and Evaluation}
\label{chapter:results}

To prove efficiency:

- Test that a given function is not made slower after being cache
  - To test this we want to trigger an underlying data change and ensure it does
    introduce performance regression
- System load:
  - Test that functions are not executed more times than necessary
- Show that caching improves performance:
  - Examples where caching improves performance
- Test the 'warm up'

Maybe not to be tested, but to be argued:
- Software design:
  - Defend the library and how it's used
- Adaptability
  - Discuss that the definition is could be improved, but fits evaluation in the cases we have
% Fault-Tolerance:
%  - If the cache is not reachable:
%    - If computation time > 10s: should return no result
%    - If computation time < 10s
%      - Should be computed
%      - BUT: Be aware of (accidental) DOS (all web requests are hold up by long running computations)
