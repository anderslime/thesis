\chapter{Results and Evaluation}
\label{chapter:results}

Possible tests (choose the ones that makes sense):

\begin{itemize}
  \item Prove that update requests are not made slower (because they are async)
  \item Test that functions are not tested when they are already fresh
  \item Test how often cached functions are executed unnecessarily
  \item Test how long it takes to warm up cache
  \item Test memory consumption of cache database when using Peergrade.io
  \item Test and compare sequential topologically sorted with parallelized
  \item Test update throughput under different write-patterns
  \item Test some QoD measurements
\end{itemize}

Discuss this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Software Design
  \item Adaptability
  \item (Fault-Tolerance)
\end{itemize}

% Fault-Tolerance:
%  - If the cache is not reachable:
%    - If computation time > 10s: should return no result
%    - If computation time < 10s
%      - Should be computed
%      - BUT: Be aware of (accidental) DOS (all web requests are hold up by long running computations)
