% Points:
% - What it is the area?
% => Find a caching solution that allowed immediate response times for cached
% values, cached values to be as up to date as possible and easy cache
% management

% - Contributions:
% => Defined a set of evaluation criteria for finding a caching strategy
% => Researched and evaluated caching techniques
% => Designed a new caching technique called 'cachable functions'
% => Cachable functions was extended with automatic invalidation using this and that
%    - Not fully transparent, but uses dependency declarations from the programmer
% => Afterwards extended with in-place updates using a data update propagation.. CONCURRENCY!
% => Implemented in Python and integrated into Peergrade.io
% => Tested and evaluated performance of update propagation that showed it scales
%    by only introducing a small overhead of a few milliseconds

% What is so nice about our solution:
% => Concurrent updates
% => Simple (or no) scheduling of update propagation
% => Application-Level cache + Flexible architecture that uses components already used in most web applications

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend with fully transparent dependency sniffing
  \item Extend with fault-tolerant measures
  \item Extend library to support other invalidation techniques => HYBRID
  \item Implement with other primary storage database technologies (such as SQL)
  \item Implement with other caching database technologies
  \item Implement with other programming languages
\end{itemize}
