\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at DTU Compute in fulfilment of the requirements for acquiring an M.Sc. in Engineering.

The thesis deals with the design and implementation of a caching system that is able to cache long running computations and always serve an immmediate response while keeping the cached content up to date.

The thesis was made in collaboration with Peergrade IVS and supervised by Nicola Dragoni and David Kofoed Wind.

The thesis consists of the following learning objectives:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Understand and describe caching
  \item Compare and evaluate different caching systems
  \item Design a push-based caching system
  \item Efficiently implement a push-based caching system
  \item Evaluate the efficiency of the caching system
\end{itemize}
