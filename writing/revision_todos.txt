# TODOS

- Tables:
  - Include references to the paper suggesting the solution
  - Remove unnecessary split lines (read Writing for Computer Science)
- Figures:
  - Ensure the figure is self-explanatory or include explaining caption
  - Be consistent: ensure a given shape always has the same meaning + use the
    same shape for the same content (e.g. same shape for data, stores etc.)
- Code:
  - Refer as listings (or source code) instead of figures
